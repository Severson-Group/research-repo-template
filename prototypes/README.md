## Purpose of Document

This document explains the contents of the prototypes folder and links to resources for documenting prototypes.

## Folder Contents

Each prototype gets its own subfolder. This subfolder should:

- `README.md` with a table summarizing the prototype nameplate ratings with links to key analyses and design documentation
- contain CAD and drawing files
- bill of materials and quotes

## How to Create a Prototypes Subfolder

At the time of creating this `README.md`, we do not have a specification for this folder. Check the latest version of our [research-repo-template](https://github.com/Severson-Group/research-repo-template/tree/main/prototypes) for up to date instructions.

In the meantime, please refer to the [examples](#examples) below.

## Examples

- AMB unloader [prototyes](https://github.com/Severson-Group/amb_unloader/tree/main/prototypes/)
- ARL repo [BP7 prototypes](https://github.com/Severson-Group/ARL-eturbo/tree/main/BP7)
- NSF Revterra [prototypes](https://github.com/Severson-Group/revterra-nsf-sttr/tree/main/Prototypes)
- Sandia [prototypes](https://github.com/Severson-Group/sandia_sco2/tree/main/Prototypes)

Note that our guidelines for creating the prototypes folder have evolved over time. Some of these example reports may have been created based on earlier guidelines.
