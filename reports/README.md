## Purpose of Document

This document explains the contents of the reports folder and links to resources for creating reports.

## Folder Contents

This folder will contain reports for the project. Each report should:

- be in its own subfolder, named using [dash-case](https://github.com/Severson-Group/KnowledgeBase/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#file-naming); i.e. `demag-analysis\` (camelCase is also acceptable in repos already using camelCase).
- contain a `README.md` file that links to any resources in the repository (i.e., model files, control/optimization code) used in the analysis
- optionally contain additional files that are necessary for its analyses and do not belong elsewhere in the repository

## How to Create Reports

Researchers in the eLev lab should follow instructions provided in their [Knowledgebase Article](https://github.com/Severson-Group/KnowledgeBase/blob/main/writing/write-repo-report.md).

## Examples

- AMB unloader [reports](https://github.com/Severson-Group/amb_unloader/tree/main/Reports)
- ARL repo [BP4 reports](https://github.com/Severson-Group/ARL-eturbo/tree/main/BP4/Control/Reports)
- ARL repo [BP7 reports](https://github.com/Severson-Group/ARL-eturbo/tree/main/BP7/Reports)
- NSF PFI [reports](https://github.com/Severson-Group/nsf_pfi_bearingless/tree/main/Reports)
- Sandia [reports](https://github.com/Severson-Group/sandia_sco2/tree/main/Reports)

Note that our guidelines for creating reports have evolved over time. Some of these example reports may have been created based on earlier guidelines.
