## Purpose of Document

This document explains the contents of the publications folder and links to resources for creating publication archives.

## Folder Contents

Each publication (conference or journal paper) gets its own subfolder. This subfolder should:

- have a [name reflective of the publication venue and year](https://github.com/Severson-Group/KnowledgeBase/blob/main/writing/archive-research-material.md#file-placement-and-naming-convention), i.e. `ECCE2025`;
- contain a `README.md` file that explains the publication and links to any resources in the repository (i.e., model files, control/optimization code) used in the article;
- optionally contain additional files that are necessary for its analyses and do not belong elsewhere in the repository.

## How to Create a Publication Subfolder

Researchers in the eLev lab should follow instructions provided in their [Knowledgebase Article](https://github.com/Severson-Group/KnowledgeBase/blob/main/writing/archive-research-material.md).

## Examples

- AMB unloader [publications](https://github.com/Severson-Group/amb_unloader/tree/main/publications)
- ARL repo [publications](https://github.com/Severson-Group/ARL-eturbo/tree/main/Publications)
- NSF Revterra [publications](https://github.com/Severson-Group/revterra-nsf-sttr/tree/main/Publications)
- Sandia [publications](https://github.com/Severson-Group/sandia_sco2/tree/main/Publications)

Note that our guidelines for creating publications folders have evolved over time. Some of these example reports may have been created based on earlier guidelines.
