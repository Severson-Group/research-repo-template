## Purpose of Document

This document explains the contents of the modeling folder and links to resources for documenting models.

## Folder Contents

This folder typically contains the [eMachPrivate](https://github.com/Severson-Group/eMachPrivate) repo as a submodule and may also contain other model folders and modeling and optimization code as well as Simulink models.

Each modeling initiative gets its own subfolder. However, there should be only one [eMachPrivate](https://github.com/Severson-Group/eMachPrivate) submodule.

## How to Create a Modeling Subfolder

At the time of creating this `README.md`, we do not have a specification for this folder. Check the latest version of our [research-repo-template](https://github.com/Severson-Group/research-repo-template/tree/main/modeling) for up to date instructions.

In the meantime, please refer to the [examples](#examples) below.

## Examples

- AMB unloader [modeling](https://github.com/Severson-Group/amb_unloader/tree/main/modeling/)
- ARL repo [BP7 modeling](https://github.com/Severson-Group/ARL-eturbo/tree/main/BP7/Modeling)
- NSF PFI [modeling](https://github.com/Severson-Group/nsf_pfi_bearingless/tree/main/modeling)
- Sandia [modeling](https://github.com/Severson-Group/sandia_sco2/tree/main/modeling)

Note that our guidelines for creating modeling folders have evolved over time. Some of these example reports may have been created based on earlier guidelines.
